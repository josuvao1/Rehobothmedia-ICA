Wonderful, so wonderful

Is Your unfailing love

Your cross has spoken mercy over me

No eye has seen no ear has heard

No heart could fully know

How glorious, how beautiful You are



Beautiful one I love

Beautiful one I adore

Beautiful one my soul must sing



Powerful so powerful

Your glory fills the skies

Your mighty works displayed for all to see

The beauty of Your majesty

Awakes my heart to see

How marvelous how wonderful You are



Beautiful one I love

Beautiful one I adore

Beautiful one my soul must sing



Beautiful one I love

Beautiful one I adore

Beautiful one my soul must sing



My Soul my soul must Sing x (3) 
Beautiful One...
