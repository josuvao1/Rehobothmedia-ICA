Light of the world
You stepped down into darkness
Opened my eyes let me see
Beauty that made this heart adore you
Hope of the life spend with you

Ch: Here I am to worship
Here I am to bow down
Here I am to say that
You are my God
You’re altogether lovely
Altogether worthy
Altogether wonderful to me

King of all days
Oh so highly exalted
glorious in heaven above
Humble you came
Yo the earth you created
All for love sake become poor
I’ll never know how much it cost
To see my sin upon that cross
